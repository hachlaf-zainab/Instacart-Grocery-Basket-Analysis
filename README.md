## Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates via app. My task is to suggest strategies for better customer segmentation in order for Instacart to target the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

**Data** Several open-source data sets from [Instacart](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis) that were provided by Career Foundry on
- customers
- orders
- products
- departments

**Files** The analysis is compartmentalized into 5 main subfolders
1. Project management, which contains the project brief.
2. Data, which contains all used data sets in original and transformed form. (This folder is not included in the upload)
3. Scripts, which contain all Notebooks run to explore and transform the data.
4. Analysis, which contains all visualizations created to gain insights and include in final report.
5. Sent to client, which contains the final report sent to stakeholders.
